# *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* RASE database

## Methods

The *N. gonorrhoeae* RASE database was constructed with the CDC GISP breakpoints ([mg/L]): azithromycin (AZM): 2.0, cefixime (CFM): 0.25, ciprofloxacin (CIP): 1.0, and ceftriaxone (CRO): 0.125. Before applying the breakpoints, azithromycin MICs for strains collected before 2005 were doubled in order to correct for the known inconsistencies of the phenotyping protocol due to a change in formulation of the commercial media.

The draft assemblies and the phylogenetic tree were downloaded from Zenodo (accession: ‘10.5281/zenodo.2618836’). Three prevalent types of plasmids48 were downloaded from GenBank, localized in the GISP database using BLAST49, and removed from the dataset: the cryptic plasmid (‘pJD1’, GenBank accession ‘NC_001377.1’), the beta-lactamase plasmid (‘pJD4’, GenBank accession ‘NC_002098.1’), and the conjugative plasmid (‘pEP5289’, GenBank accession ‘GU479466.1’). The gonococcal ProPhyle index was constructed with the k-mer size k=18.
